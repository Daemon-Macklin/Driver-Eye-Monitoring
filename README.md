# Detecting Driver Weariness Using Cameras

This is a matlab project where I investigated being able to detect the eye state of a driver. 

The two files are for the methods I tested.

1. ModelBuilding.m - Was using classification to detect eyes in an image.
2. eyeDetection.m - Was using circle detection to detect eyes in an image.

The closedEyes and openEyes folders have the images used for the training data for classification.
